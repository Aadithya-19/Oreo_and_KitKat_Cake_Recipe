# Oreo_and_KitKat_Cake_Recipe
This is a recipe I have created by myself, the key ingredients are Oreo, KitKat, Hersey Syrup, butter and milk. First you separate the Oreo biscuit from the cream part. Then grind the biscuit into fine pieces and some milk at a time and mix until you get a liquid solution, not solid. Then add butter in a tray you are cooking it in, and rub it genuinely. Now add some batter into the bowl and spread it evenly(note : add only some because we need the rest for the top layer.) Now place it in a pan with some water already boiling, place the bowl in it and seal it air tight for 5 minutes in high flame. After you get a sponge like cake turn off the flame and add the Oreo cream e separated earlier on top. After adding the cream add the KitKat pieces by breaking them in half. Now add rest of the batter and turn on the flame, seal it air tight and keep the flame on high for another 5 to 10 minutes. After it has been cooked well, turn of the flame and let it cool. Now transfer it into a bowl and another two half broken pieces of KitKat and just spread the syrup evenly. Cut it and ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
